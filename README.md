# rocketLeague

So far, the app can fetch and display the stats for a user in either xbox or ps4. Once I get the xbox fetch to work completely, i will update the ps4 fetch as well as adding a fetch for steam. 

It will display the stats that were found from rocketleaguestats.com. I am currently working on retrieving the rank (which is done), displaying the rank, and also displaying the associated image for the users rank. I will also add a page that displays if the username that was typed in fetched the "user not found page."




Edit (1/18/2017): Added statScraper class. This handles the HTML parsing and fetching. 

Edit (1/21/2017): statScraper completed! Got the completionhandler to work. added functions in the view controller to update the screen
