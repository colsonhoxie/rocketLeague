# rocketLeague

So far, the app can fetch and display the stats for a user in either xbox or ps4. Once I get the xbox fetch to work completely, i will update the ps4 fetch as well as adding a fetch for steam. 

It will display the stats that were found from rocketleaguestats.com. I am currently working on retrieving the rank (which is done), displaying the rank, and also displaying the associated image for the users rank. I will also add a page that displays if the username that was typed in fetched the "user not found page."

I feel the code is quite crude, especially using those while loops. Let me know if you see anything else that could help it run faster or result in shorter code.
